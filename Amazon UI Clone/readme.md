# CSS `border-box` Property Documentation

In Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), the `border` property enables the addition of a border around an element such as a box or container. When employing the `border-box` value, it denotes that the size of the element encompasses both the border and padding, without augmenting the overall size of the element.

For instance, suppose you designate an element with a width of 100 pixels and subsequently add a 2-pixel border to it. In this scenario, the total width of the element will persist at 100 pixels, accommodating the border within that width.

This contrasts with the default behavior, where the size specified for an element does not incorporate the border and padding. Consequently, appending a border would inflate the overall size of the element.

Employing `border-box` fosters consistency and facilitates enhanced control over webpage layout. This property ensures that the specified dimensions accurately represent the content area of the element, encompassing both the border and padding.

## Example Usage

Consider the following HTML markup:

```html
<div class="box"></div>
```

Accompanied by the corresponding CSS styling:

```css
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 2px solid black;
  padding: 10px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

In this example, utilizing `box-sizing: border-box;` ensures that the specified width and height (100px by 100px) encompass the border and padding. Consequently, despite the 2-pixel border and 10-pixel padding, the content area of the box remains consistent at 76 pixels by 76 pixels.

## How `border-box` Operates

1. **Without `box-sizing: border-box;`**:

   - If the width and height of the box are set to 100 pixels each, incorporating a 2-pixel border and 10-pixel padding would extend the overall size of the box. Consequently, the total width would amount to 124 pixels, inclusive of borders and padding.

2. **With `box-sizing: border-box;`**:
   - By specifying `border-box`, the designated width and height of the box comprehensively incorporate the border and padding. Thus, the content area within the box remains constant at 100 pixels by 100 pixels, irrespective of the border and padding. This ensures that the border and padding are encompassed within the specified dimensions, preserving consistency in layout design.

Utilizing `border-box` facilitates precise control over element dimensions, particularly when managing borders and padding, thereby enhancing the overall coherence and predictability of webpage layout.
